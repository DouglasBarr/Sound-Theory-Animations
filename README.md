Sound-Theory-Animations
=======================

This project contains a series of prototypes of interactive animations designed to help teach sound theory, properties of waveforms and digital audio. The code has been created using [Processing](https://www.processing.org).

Currently, the project currently contains animations to help describe:

1. Amplitude
2. Frequency
3. Comparisons between a sin wave and the unit circle. 
4. Comparisons with other example of simple harmonic motion.
5. Sampling rate
6. Bit depth
